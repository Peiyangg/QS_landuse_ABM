This project is a NetLogo simulation aimed at modeling the transition of land use from agriculture to development. It utilizes GIS data to create a realistic representation of a town (Qishan, Shaanxi, China), including agricultural areas, eco-protected zones, development regions, and road networks. The simulation tracks changes in land use, specifically focusing on how agricultural land is converted into developed areas, such as residential zones.

You can adjust 'index_of_landscape_value' and 'index_of_agri_value' these two indices to stimulate different policies.
